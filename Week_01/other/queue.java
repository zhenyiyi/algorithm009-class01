  18:  * implementations; in most implementations, insert operations cannot

  45:  * <p>Queues typically, but do not necessarily, order elements in a
  46:  * FIFO (first-in-first-out) manner.  Among the exceptions are
  47:  * priority queues, which order elements according to a supplied
  48:  * comparator, or the elements' natural ordering, and LIFO queues (or
  49:  * stacks) which order the elements LIFO (last-in-first-out).
  50:  * Whatever the ordering used, the <em>head</em> of the queue is that
  51:  * element which would be removed by a call to {@link #remove() } or
  52:  * {@link #poll()}.  In a FIFO queue, all new elements are inserted at
  53:  * the <em> tail</em> of the queue. Other kinds of queues may use
  54:  * different placement rules.  Every <tt>Queue</tt> implementation
  55:  * must specify its ordering properties.
  56:  *
  57:  * <p>The {@link #offer offer} method inserts an element if possible,
  58:  * otherwise returning <tt>false</tt>.  This differs from the {@link
  59:  * java.util.Collection#add Collection.add} method, which can fail to
  60:  * add an element only by throwing an unchecked exception.  The
  61:  * <tt>offer</tt> method is designed for use when failure is a normal,
  62:  * rather than exceptional occurrence, for example, in fixed-capacity
  63:  * (or &quot;bounded&quot;) queues.
  64:  *
  65:  * <p>The {@link #remove()} and {@link #poll()} methods remove and
  66:  * return the head of the queue.
  67:  * Exactly which element is removed from the queue is a
  68:  * function of the queue's ordering policy, which differs from
  69:  * implementation to implementation. The <tt>remove()</tt> and
  70:  * <tt>poll()</tt> methods differ only in their behavior when the
  71:  * queue is empty: the <tt>remove()</tt> method throws an exception,
  72:  * while the <tt>poll()</tt> method returns <tt>null</tt>.
  73:  *
  74:  * <p>The {@link #element()} and {@link #peek()} methods return, but do
  75:  * not remove, the head of the queue.
  76:  *
  77:  * <p>The <tt>Queue</tt> interface does not define the <i>blocking queue
  78:  * methods</i>, which are common in concurrent programming.  These methods,
  79:  * which wait for elements to appear or for space to become available, are
  80:  * defined in the {@link java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue} interface, which
  81:  * extends this interface.
  82:  *
  83:  * <p><tt>Queue</tt> implementations generally do not allow insertion
  84:  * of <tt>null</tt> elements, although some implementations, such as
  85:  * {@link LinkedList}, do not prohibit insertion of <tt>null</tt>.
  86:  * Even in the implementations that permit it, <tt>null</tt> should
  87:  * not be inserted into a <tt>Queue</tt>, as <tt>null</tt> is also
  88:  * used as a special return value by the <tt>poll</tt> method to
  89:  * indicate that the queue contains no elements.
  90:  *
  91:  * <p><tt>Queue</tt> implementations generally do not define
  92:  * element-based versions of methods <tt>equals</tt> and
  93:  * <tt>hashCode</tt> but instead inherit the identity based versions
  94:  * from class <tt>Object</tt>, because element-based equality is not
  95:  * always well-defined for queues with the same elements but different
  96:  * ordering properties.
